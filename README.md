# INSTAGRAM CLONE (I will make REACT version with way better coding than this one!)

This was a project for school.

I made a socialmedia website that looks like Instagram.


PHP7 (oop) - PDO - Ajax - jQuery in a MVC structure.

# Features
Login/Register.

Follow/Unfollow people.

Upload images for your profile.

Like/Unlike posts.

Comment on posts.

Tag people in posts.

Get notified when someone likes a photo.

Searchbar to search for users.

Settings to change profile picture and bio.

Funny addon: verified mark next to name.

# I'm not gonna continue this project
I want to make a new and better version of the Instagram clone from scratch.
I want to use React because I really want to use it.
